## Requirements  

The code is written in Python and relies on PyTorch. The following libraries are required:  

- Python 3  
- PyTorch  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

The provided notebooks are ready to run on Google Colab.  

## Running Synthetic Experiments  

The following two files were used to produce Figure 1 in the paper:  
- `Scaling_Wishart.ipynb`  
- `Scaling_Wigner.ipynb`  

A run of Algorithm 1 is demonstrated in the file `Recovery_Wishart.ipynb`.
