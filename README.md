# Nonasymptotic Guarantees for Low-Rank Matrix Recovery with Generative Priors

This repository contains the accompanying code for

*''Nonasymptotic Guarantees for Low-Rank Matrix Recovery with Generative Priors''*

## Requirements

The code is written in Python and relies on Pytorch. The following libraries are required:

-   python 3
-   pytorch
-   numpy
-   matplotlib

The provided notebooks are ready to run on Google Colab.

## Running synthetic experiments
The following two files were used to produce Figure 1 in the paper
-  ` Scaling_Wishart.ipynb`
-  ` Scaling_Wigner.ipynb`

A run of Algorithm 1 is demonstrated in the file `Recovery_Wishart.ipynb`
